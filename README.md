It works with the concept of 'services' ,
everything is a service and maybe later replacable with a user application, 
WingOS has 4 syscalls : 
```
SEND_SERVICE_SYSCALL            = 1        // send a message to a service

READ_SERVICE_SYSCALL            = 2        // read all message that you have

GET_RESPONSE_SERVICE_SYSCALL    = 3        // if the message sended has been responded

GET_PROCESS_GLOBAL_DATA         = 4        // get process global data, if arg1 (target) is nullptr, return self global data, else return a process global data return -1 if there is an error
```
the user application communicates with the kernel through kernel services : 
    - graphic_buffer_service
    - kernel_process_service
    - memory_service
    - print_service // may be changed
    - ps2_device_service
    - time_service
    ...

the user can create services too, like the graphic_system_service app, in app/graphic_system_service/

it is easy and fast.

oh and the kernel supports smp multithreading <3

and some services are called ORS (On Request Service)

ORS are only active when they receive a message.

To build WingOS, go to Build_guide.md <3
