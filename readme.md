# Wingos

WingOS is a small hobbyist 64 bit kernel made with <3 in C++ 

</div>

I am currently working on this rewrite. 
If you want to see the original version, you can checkout the [old branch](https://github.com/Supercip971/WingOS/tree/old). Please note that I wrote the old version when I was a beginner in C++ and OS development 3-4 years ago, and I have learned a lot since then.

If you are interested in seeing much more advanced, working, and cool projects, you should visit the [brutal](https://github.com/brutal-org/brutal) project or [skift](https://github.com/skift-org/skift).

Please be aware that this rewrite is a work in progress. And due to my current schedule and first year engineering school exams, I don't have much time to work on it.

## Dependencies

- The project uses the [cutekit](https://github.com/cute-engineering/cutekit) build system.
- The project uses [limine](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine) as a bootloader.
